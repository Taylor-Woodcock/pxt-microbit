# Introduction to Energy

## A four part energy introduction

This course is targeted to middle school grades 6-8 (ages 11-14 years).  It is also written for teachers who may not have a Computer Science background, or who may be teaching an "Intro to Computer Science" course for the first time.

This course takes approximately 14 weeks to complete, spending about 1 week on each of the first 11 lessons, and 3 weeks for students to complete the final project at the end.  Of course, teachers should feel free to customize the curriculum to meet individual school or district resources and timeframe.

### Lesson structure

Each of the 12 lessons is structured in this format:
* Topic Introduction
* Unplugged Activity (30 min) - An offline game or activity that demonstrates the concept/topic
* micro:bit Activity (45-60 min) - An activity that everyone makes on their micro:bit that teaches the skills learned in this lesson.
* Project (60-120 min) - A prompt for an original project that each student will create to demonstrate their understanding of the skills and concepts covered in this lesson.
* Project Mods - Examples of additional things students can do to extend the project.
* Assessment - A project rubric and guidance for grading the project.
* Standards - A list of CSTA K-12 Computer Science Standards and/or concepts covered by this lesson.
