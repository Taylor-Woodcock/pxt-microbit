## Resources

### Energy lets save it (3:39) - fun cartoon video for all ages.

A family is carelessly and unknowingly wasting energy from the moment they wake up. Until something unexpectedly happens.  Can lead into discussion about what the family is doing to reduce energy e.g. changing light bulbs, turning down the room thermostat temperature, using a bus not cars

### TED Ed - Climate change: Earth's giant game of Tetris (2:49) – A bit more advanced

There's a game of Tetris happening on a global scale: The playing space is planet Earth, and all those pesky, stacking blocks represent carbon dioxide -- a greenhouse gas that is piling up ever more rapidly as we burn the fossil fuels that run our cars, factories and power plants. Joss Fong outlines how this overload of CO2 leads to climate change and reminds us that, unlike Tetris, we won't get an opportunity to start over and try again.

### Climate change, according to a kid aged 12 (2:11) – A bit more advanced

Lovely animation made in 2015 about climate change. References the Paris Agreement in 2015.

### NASA website Climate kids

Lots of games / interesting factoids to teach pupils about climate change.

## Objective

Revisit the success criteria with pupils and check for any questions.

## Procedures

Ask pupils to work in pairs or small groups and write in their books the answers to the 5 questions.

Briefly go over the answers with them.

What did they find out that was new to them?

Check if they have any questions.

## Potential Curriculum Connections

You might want to add extension activities on related curriculum areas like:

### KS3 Biology – relationships in an ecosystem
* Explore the interdependence of organisms in an ecosystem, including food webs and insect pollinated crops 
* Explore further why insect pollinators are vital for plant reproduction and in human food security
* Consider the importance of how organisms affect, and are affected by, their environment, including the accumulation of toxic materials.

E.g. What is a toxic material (carbon dioxide occurs naturally. When does it become toxic?)
What other toxic materials are there? (plastics, air pollution, chemical pollutants).

### KS3 Chemistry
The carbon cycle

Earth as a source of limited resources and the efficacy of recycling (e.g. link to methane and landfill sites)

### KS2 and 3 English
Organise a debate on climate change where pupils can present their views, maintaining a focus on the topic and using notes where necessary, and provide reasoned justifications for their views.

### Citizenship
Understand more about the roles played by public institutions and voluntary groups in society, and the ways in which citizens work together to improve their communities, including opportunities to participate in school-based activities.
