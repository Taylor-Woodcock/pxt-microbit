# Global Warming and its Effect on Climate (10 minutes)

![Placeholder](/static/eis/lessons/placeholder_640x360.png)

## Objective

**This follows on from the previous lesson.**

To understand the process of global warming as caused by greenhouse gases from the burning of fossil fuels and its effect on the earth’s climate and weather patterns.


## Procedures

### Fuel types, fossil fuels

The last lesson briefly touched on greenhouse gases, with the description below. You may want to do a quick recap on the pros and cons of fossil fuels and renewables if lessons are not delivered close together.

'**Greenhouse gases**, just like being in a greenhouse, create a warm environment. Examples of a greenhouse gases are **carbon dioxide and methane** (Carbon dioxide is released from burning fossil fuels. Methane occurs naturally but also is produced at landfill sites (rubbish dumps) and from livestock farming).'

Show the power station slide. Ask pupils WHAT is the problem with greenhouse gases?

'**Greenhouse** gases create a warm environment because they go up into the atmosphere and wrap round the earth like a blanket.  The sun’s heat is absorbed into the dark earth surface, but it can’t all escape back out because of this blanket of gases.  The world is **heating up** as a result. This is called **global warming**.
**Greenhouse gases stay around for a long time – some for hundreds of years – so what we do now has a big impact on the future temperature and life on this planet.'**

## ~ hint
Show the global warming diagram slide.  

This is a fun way to explore it.

**Resources**: Bubble wrap, space blanket or ordinary blanket.  Toy penguin and polar bear or printed A5 images of them and sellotape.

Ask for one volunteer to come to the front of the class. They are going to represent the world. The bubble wrap/blanket represents greenhouse gases.
Ask the pupil if they are feeling cool or warm.
Ask the rest of the class how we waste energy in school and at our homes. (e.g. leaving lights or appliances on; opening windows and having the heating on). As they make suggestions wrap the bubble wrap around the pupil. 
Once they are wrapped up ask them how they are feeling. They should be feeling very warm!


### What happens to the world when it heats up?

Get the penguin and polar bear images/cuddly toys. Ask pupils where they live.  Put the polar bear on the pupil’s head (North Pole/Arctic, lightly sellotape image to their hair with permission) and penguin at their feet (South Pole/Antarctic). What is the weather is like in the North and South Pole? (Freezing cold, icy)
What happens to this area if the world heats up?  What happens to the polar bear and penguin? (Ice melts, loss of habitat, polar bears move into towns and eat humans! Extinction.) 

We want to prevent extinction of species. The world is a strong healthy place when it has lots of life forms.
This is called **biodiversity**.

## ~ hint
Ask pupils for their ideas on what they can do to stop wasting energy, as a way to cut greenhouse gas ‘emissions’, and so reducing global warming and climate change? 

Cover the commonly known points below.
* Turn off appliances if not in use
* Turn lights off when leaving the room. At home check you have low energy LED light bulbs.
* Have short showers
* Close doors and windows to keep heat in 
* Play outside more, and less on the Xbox 
* Walk or cycle to school

What can pupils do in school? (Turn lights and computers off... Anything else?)

As they make suggestions unwrap the pupil.

Once unwrapped ask the pupil if they are feeling cool or warm. They should be feeling cooler.
