# What We Can do to Reduce Global Warming? (10 minutes)

![Placeholder](/static/eis/lessons/placeholder_640x360.png)

## Objective

To recognize that we need to take action to reduce further climate change.

To learn what actions we can take.  

## ~hint
NB: These resources explore:
* Everyday actions - reducing energy waste at home and school -  we can all do to cut greenhouse gas emissions
* Renewable energy actions 
* Children as climate activists, getting their voices heard about their concerns about climate change 

**Please check the resources and decide if you feel it is appropriate with your class to discuss Youth Climate Strikes.**

This is a useful link to Citizenship and is inspiring & empowering, particularly the video of Greta Thunberg.  

Creating a safe supportive space for pupils to discuss these issues is important.

## Procedures

Remind pupils of the start of the class, when wrapping the pupil up in the space blanket. Pupils have already described actions they can take to cut energy waste, and so reduce greenhouse gas emissions and further climate change.

You could show them the video **Energy lets save it (link below)** – a fun cartoon. Stop the video to highlight how the family is cutting energy waste e.g. turning heating down, stopping draughts.
There are other videos below which may also be appropriate for your pupils.

Show the slide ‘What can we do to reduce global warming?’
* Everyday actions – Know **how** we use energy, then **manage and reduce energy use** at home and school. We can all do to this, and it cuts greenhouse gas emissions.  The next lesson explores this more.
* At home pupils can choose an energy supplier that gets their energy from renewable sources.   
* At home and school you can generate your own electricity with solar panels or a small wind turbine, or have a renewable form of heating.  Show the slide of ‘solar schools’.

### Greta Thunberg and Youth Climate Strikes 
In 2019, young people have been increasingly active in voicing their concerns about climate change.  Share with pupils the story and slide on Greta Thunberg a Swedish girl of 16.

Show the 2 minute video of her speaking https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDBJMqZ6lWI&t=2s

She doesn’t think governments are doing enough about climate change. She has now spoken with heads of state and at international meetings with 1000’s of people. She helped spark Youth Climate Strikes in 100 countries.
(Depending on your class, you may need to explain what a strike is.)

Councils around the UK are now ‘declaring a climate emergency’ – with an intention to take action on climate change.
Show the slide with the UK map of councils that have declared a climate emergency.

Is your council on the map? https://climateemergency.uk/blog/map-of-local-council-declarations/

Greta Thunberg has made a massive difference by speaking the truth about climate change.  
Ask pupils what they think. 

## ~hint
Encourage them to talk to family and friends about climate change, as Greta did to begin with. 

They can contact their MP and ask them to speak up about climate change.  Could you do that collectively as a school?

They will also be taking practical actions around school, helping the school reduce its fuel bill.  

They will find out more about best actions to take to cut energy waste at home.  Lots we can all do!
