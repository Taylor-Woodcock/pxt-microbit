# How Plants, Animals and Humans are Affected by Climate Change (15 minutes)

![Placeholder](/static/eis/lessons/placeholder_640x360.png)

## Objective

To learn how global warming is affecting plant, animal and human life, and what might happen in the future.

## ~hint
Resources: 

* World Climate Zones/Biomes Map – 1 per pupil e.g. 
https://classroomsecrets.co.uk/world-biomes-map/ (log in needed, has colouring format for different abilities) or 
first page of https://catalogue.anspear.com/education/samples/S_492110.pdf 


* Colouring pens

## Procedures

Show the slide of Climate Zones on Earth.

Ask pupils to colour in the World Biome/Climate Zones map. 

Pupils work in pairs or groups on a specific biome/climate zone. They use books and/or the internet to find out the animals and plants in it.

Ask them to research what changes have occurred and might happen in that climate zone as global temperatures increase. They write in notebooks likely effects on plants, animals and people.

Show the slide with images of water, food and a UK flooded road.

What will happen to water supply, food supply and where people/animals/plants live?

Ask pupils to share with the class what they have found out.

## ~hint
Some of these short videos of people’s stories by Practical Action may be useful https://practicalaction.org/videos-climate-change-1 e.g. Climate change in Kenya, Impact of flooding - Samedul Islam or Naszul Islam, Coping with climate change in Nepal, The effect of climate change on farming.

**NB: some videos have subtitles.**

Point out that weather patterns influenced by climate change can damage homes, cause deaths and affect people’s health. It affects us in the UK e.g. hot summers, mild winters, excessive rain and flooding, loss of homes in coastal and low lying areas (like London, the Thames Estuary, East Anglia, South Wales, Yorkshire, or North West Scotland).

How has it affected your city or town?


### Extension activity
Ask pupils to work in pairs to answer questions about specific places, people, animals and plants.

Add in your own or pupil’s questions – these are examples (references are advanced).

1) Why are insects in decline and can we do anything about it?

2) What has happened to animal populations on Earth since 1970?

3) What could happen to people who live on Pacific islands? 
KS3 only, or just use starting pages ftp://ftp.soest.hawaii.edu/coastal/USAPI_CLimateChangeBooklets/Marshall%20Islands%20Climate%202016.pdf

Ask pupils to present to each other what they have found out.  If they are talking about a specific area locate it on the World biome map. How do pupils feel about what they’ve found out?
