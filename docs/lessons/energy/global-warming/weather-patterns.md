# Global warming and changing weather patterns (15 minutes)

![Placeholder](/static/eis/lessons/placeholder_640x360.png)

## Objective

To find out more about global warming and how we experience changing weather patterns.

## Procedures

See the slide ‘Carbon dioxide levels’ – it shows carbon dioxide over thousands of years. 0=1950.  

There’s a better image at https://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/ 

Point out the huge jump to CURRENT levels, since the Industrial Revolution.

### Earth temperature timeline from 20,000 BCE

This fun very long cartoon image shows how human activities link with changes in carbon dioxide levels – from domesticating dogs to Stonehenge to steam engines and the internet (Americanised but worth a look).

(Links nicely to History)

Look at the NASA Global Temperature page
https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/global-temperature/  


Play the bottom Time Series 1884-last year animation (2018 at time of writing). It shows how the Earth’s temperature has changed over this time.

In the UK **9 of the 10 warmest years on record have been since 2005** (we have 124 years of records)
https://www.livescience.com/64700-2018-heat-record.html (6.2.19)

**Five of the warmest years** on record happened within the last five years (2014 to 2018).
The average temperature since 2008 is 0.8C hotter and ‘notably wetter’ than for 1960-1990    

## ~ hint
Ask pupils to get into small groups to discuss how weather patterns have changed in the UK – what changes do we experience now that could be influenced by climate change? (we can’t say that weather patterns are ‘definitely caused by’ climate change).  (e.g. hot summers, no snow in winter, changes in length of seasons, flooding)

Ask them to search the internet to find out about recent global changes in weather patterns, and to write this in their notebooks. What changes are expected in the future? 
The NASA website https://climate.nasa.gov/effects/ is useful but complex.
This gives a brief introduction https://bit.ly/2UeuALt 
You could mention or ask them to search for:
* Increased rain and possible flooding
* Droughts and heat waves
* Forest fires
* Storms, hurricanes and other extreme weather
