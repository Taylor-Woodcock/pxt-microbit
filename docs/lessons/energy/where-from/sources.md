# Different Energy Sources (20-30 minutes)

![Placeholder](/static/eis/lessons/placeholder_640x360.png)

## Objective

To introduce different fuel types commonly used in school and at home, which can also be used to generate electricity.
To explore the breadth of energy sources available to generate electricity and heat.
To identify these energy sources as fossil fuels or renewable energy sources.

## Procedures

### Fuel types, fossil fuels

Show the slide with the images of coal, gas and oil on it. Ask the pupils to name them. Ask them:

* How many of them have gas cookers?  If your area is off gas, what fuel is used? (oil, wood, or electricity?)
* Ask where coal, gas and oil come from. (mines, out of the ground)
* Do pupils know what these fuels were originally? (plant material, millions of years ago)
* Does anyone know what the collective term for these fuels is? (fossil fuels)
* If they have come out of the ground, is there a limited or unlimited supply? (limited)


### Give a brief overview of ‘the journey of coal’

* Coal, gas and oil are all made out of fossilised plant material which sedimented and with heat and pressure created rock – coal.
* Coal is dug out of the earth from a coal mine, and transported to a Power Station 
* There it is burnt and the heat made changes water into steam, which turns a turbine containing a generator, which generates electricity.
* The electricity leaves the power station and is send via the national grid – the network of power lines and pylons – to buildings across the country.
* Electricity passes through a meter (which measures how much electricity is used), and we use it to power appliances.


Coal, gas and oil can all be used to generate electricity and heat, but there are other energy sources too.


### Renewable energy sources

NB: You may want to print out one copy in colour A3 single sided of the renewable energy sources, for more class interaction, rather than use the Power Point.
If so ask for 8 volunteers to come to the front of the class and hold up an image each.

The images are of renewable energy technologies used to generate heat or electricity. 
Ask the class to name each image. What is the natural energy source it uses e.g. sun, wind, tide (names and brief explanation of each is given below.)

### Possible questions to ask the class

* Have they seen solar panels and wind turbines?  
* Does anyone have solar panels at home? 
* Mention if the school has them (or a wind turbine or biomass boiler).


NB: Go into as much or as little detail as you want to on how electricity is generated from each source. Pupils are likely to ask about this.  There are slides included for this which you can hide if you want to (especially the heat pump slide which is more complex and brings in new terminology). **This could be a great extension activity for pupils if time is short**.


There are two basic models for electricity generation, plus the heat pump example for heat:

1. Turning blades, which turn a turbine and generator to generate electricity e.g. wind, tidal, hydroelectric power. 
2. Solar PV is a ‘silicon sandwich’ where heat from the sun excites electrons – this usefully emphasises that electricity is a flow of charge.  
3. Heat pumps work via a change in state (heat changes a liquid refrigerant to a vapour) and in effect they ‘move heat’ from outside the home to inside it. 


1.	**Solar photovoltaic panels** – generate electricity from sunlight. The panel is a ‘silicon sandwich’ with a negative layer on top, and a positive layer on the bottom. The sunlight excites negatively-charged electrons in the top layer, which move to the positive side. Put two metal contacts on either side of the silicon sandwich and you get an electric current flowing through a circuit. This flow of charge is the electricity.
2.	**Onshore wind power** – the wind rotate the turbine blades which turns a generator which generates electricity 
3.	**Offshore wind power** – as for on shore wind
4.	**Tidal power** - the water moving back and forth with the tide turns the blades which turns turbines and a generator, which generates electricity
5.	**Hydroelectric power** – The falling water begins as gravitational energy, and then converts to mechanical energy as the force of the water turns the turbine. The generator connected to the turbine rotates, changing the mechanical energy to electrical energy. The transformers convert the electricity to usable voltage levels. 
The electricity is then sent through the transmission lines to distribution stations and our homes.
6.	**Biomass** - The big tall grass is called Miscanthus. It grows very quickly. Wood and wood pellets are at the bottom. All can be burnt in a biomass boiler (the fire) for heating. Biomass = ‘Biological material’ 
7.	**Solar thermal tubes** – heat water from sunlight
8.	**Air and Ground Source Heat Pumps** – act like a fridge in reverse. Coils in the ground or in a fan coil unit (as shown in the pictures) contain cool liquid refrigerant (1) which boils at a low temperature. The refrigerant absorbs heat from the earth or air and changes into a cold vapour (2).  The vapour is compressed (which needs electricity) and becomes hot and is at high pressure (3).  It passes the heat to water in a tank (the heat sink); the water heats up and the vapour cools down to a warm liquid state (4).  **NB: Numbers above refer to the heat pump diagram.**


Does anyone know what the collective term for these energy sources is? (Renewable energy)

Because they come from the sun, wind and tide, is their supply limited or unlimited? (unlimited)

### Different physical geographies and renewable energy

Show the images of different landscapes one at a time. Ask the class what renewable energy technology could be used in this place to generate electricity?  (Is there lots of water, sun, wind?)

Picture 1:  Mountains and water, maybe in Wales or Scotland. Hydroelectric power.

Picture 2: Lots of sunshine, maybe in Africa or South America. Solar PV.

Picture 3: A windy outcrop, maybe in Norway, Denmark or the UK.  On shore wind power.
