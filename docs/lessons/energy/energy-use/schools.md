# Pros and Cons of Different Energy Sources (10 minutes)

## Objective

To understand the pros and cons of different energy sources – fossil fuels, renewables and nuclear.

## Procedures

Ask pupils what happens to renewable energy generation at different times of day and the year.

What happens to solar power at night time?  What about when the wind doesn’t blow?

This is called ‘intermittent’ electricity generation – when there isn’t a steady supply.

This is a downside to renewable energy sources.


Before showing them the Pros and Cons table, restate what ‘Fossil Fuel’ and ‘Renewable energy source’ mean re. where they come from and if supply is limited or unlimited.

Ask pupils to work in pairs, draw a Pros and Cons table and fill it in with the information they already have. Prompt them about the downside of burning fossil fuels. (Pollution and greenhouse gases)

Show them the completed table, and clarify what is meant by ‘greenhouse gases’ (briefly explained below). Do they know the names of any?

‘**Greenhouse gases**, just like being in a greenhouse, create a warm environment. Examples of a greenhouse gases are **carbon dioxide and methane** (Carbon dioxide is released from burning fossil fuels. Methane occurs naturally but also is produced at landfill sites (rubbish dumps) and from livestock farming).’

The third point about electricity being wasted in its long journey from power station to home or school is often missed. 13% is lost in transmission!  We can make renewable energy on our roof or in our neighbourhood – less energy waste.

Fossil fuels are useful because the power station can be powered up at any time. The problem with renewables and intermittency – we should soon be able to solve this with **batteries**, at home or on wheels (i.e. electric cars).


### Nuclear power

Ask pupils if they know about nuclear power.  What fuel does it use and where does it come from?
Can it give a constant supply of electricity, or is it intermittent.



Depending on pupil ability and time, you may want to ask pupils to work in pairs/small groups to draw up a table and research in books or the internet the pros and cons of nuclear power. They could also decide if they think it is a good idea or not.

Nuclear power is highly contentious. It is low on greenhouse gas pollution, but is not renewable.
Go through the table with pupils.
We might need nuclear power, just to avoid using fossil fuels.
