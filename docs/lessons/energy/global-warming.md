| Lesson Objectives | Success Criteria |
|-|-|
| We are learning about global warming and its effect on the earth’s climate and weather patterns | Explain the terms ‘greenhouse gases’ and ‘global warming’ |
| We are thinking about what global warming means for plant and animal (including human) life on this planet | Give 2 examples of weather patterns we now experience influenced by climate change |
| We explore what we can do to cut greenhouse gas emissions and reduce further climate change | Give an example of how plants, animals and humans have already been influenced by climate change |
| | Describe 4 expected consequences of climate change on water supply, food supply and where people/animals/plants live |
| | Give 2 examples of what they can do to cut greenhouse gas emissions and reduce climate change |
